Predictions of 2019 Canadian Federal Election If All Eligible Citizens Had Voted Using Logistic Regression Model Fitting and Post-Stratification with 2011 GSS Data
This report predicts the 2019 Canadian federal election results assuming that every eligible voter had participated in the voting. With the fitting the data obtained to a logistic regression model, and post-stratification prediction using data collected from the 2011 Canada General Social Survey, the report obtained some interesting results. In short,  the results suggested that the Conservative Party would obtain a slightly higher percentage of votes nation-wide than the Liberal Party, which showed similar results as the actual outcome with the Liberal Party obtaining fewer shares of votes, but this also suggests the Conservative Party could have won the election in general . This particular finding once again supports the general idea that every eligible voter should cast their votes in order to obtain the most optimal results in any election.
